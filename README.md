# Daryiaon Johnson's SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! In my portfolio, I have assembled a series of SQL projects and exercises that reflect my foundational understanding of database management and query writing. These projects include creating, querying, and modifying databases, as well as retrieving specific data based on various criteria. While I'm still in the early stages of my SQL journey, this portfolio serves as a starting point to showcase my growing expertise in this essential data manipulation and retrieval language.
